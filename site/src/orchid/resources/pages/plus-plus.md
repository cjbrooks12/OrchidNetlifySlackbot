# About and Usage

Credera++ is a simple slackbot to rate your friends! Simply `++` or `--` them in Slack and let Credd be the Judge. 
Credera++ also keeps track of the reasons why someone was given points or had them taken away, for you to forever 
remember their glory or shame.

### Coming Soon (maybe...)

- Steal points from someone! Take their point and give it to yourself, or to someone else.
- Things getting too heated? Revoke someone's `++` privileges for 30 seconds and watch them squirm!
